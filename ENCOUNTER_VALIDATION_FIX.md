# Encounter Validation Fix

## Problem

Users were getting persistent Pydantic validation errors when generating FHIR Encounter resources:

```
Validation failed for Encounter: ["1 validation error for Encounter\nperiod\n Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value={'start': '2023-10-01T10:... '2023-10-01T10:30:00Z'}, input_type=dict]\n For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/extra_forbidden"]
Maximum iterations reached without completing journey
```

## Root Cause

The `fhir.resources` library uses Pydantic models with `extra='forbid'`, meaning they reject any fields not explicitly defined in the FHIR specification. The AI was generating Encounter resources with fields like `period`, `start`, `end`, `reasonCode`, and `timestamp` that are not supported in the specific version of the validation library being used.

Even though these fields are valid in the FHIR specification, the Pydantic models in `fhir.resources` don't accept them in this particular configuration.

## Solution

The fix includes three layers of protection:

### 1. Enhanced Guidance in Planning Prompt (Lines 368-376)

Added explicit warnings about forbidden fields in the planning stage:

```python
FORBIDDEN FIELDS - DO NOT suggest these in key_data (they cause validation errors):
- For Encounter: DO NOT suggest "period", "start", "end", "reasonCode", or "timestamp"
  * These fields cause "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors in the validation library
  * If you need timing information, DO NOT include it in the Encounter resource
- For Procedure: DO NOT suggest "performedDateTime" or "performedPeriod"
  * These fields are not supported in this library version
- For Observation: DO NOT suggest "valueComponent" in components
  * This field doesn't exist in the validation library
- These fields will cause the resource to fail validation no matter how they're formatted
```

### 2. Strengthened Resource-Specific Guidance (Lines 1520-1558)

Completely rewrote the Encounter-specific guidance with:

- ⚠️ emoji warnings for critical errors
- ❌ and ✅ visual indicators
- Explicit list of forbidden fields with explanations
- Instruction to use minimal example structure EXACTLY
- Clear note about not adding timing information

```python
"Encounter": """
ENCOUNTER SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- status: REQUIRED. Must be one of: planned, arrived, triaged, in-progress, onleave, finished, cancelled, entered-in-error, unknown
- class: REQUIRED. Must be a LIST containing CodeableConcept objects (NOT just Coding)
  * Each CodeableConcept should have a 'coding' array
  * Use system "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode" with codes:
    - "EMER" for emergency encounters
    - "IMP" for inpatient encounters
    - "AMB" for ambulatory/outpatient
- subject: REQUIRED. Reference to Patient resource

⚠️  CRITICAL - THESE FIELDS WILL CAUSE VALIDATION ERRORS - DO NOT USE THEM:
  * period - This field causes "Extra inputs are not permitted" error
  * start - This field causes "Extra inputs are not permitted" error
  * end - This field causes "Extra inputs are not permitted" error
  * reasonCode - Not supported in this library version
  * timestamp - Not supported in this library version

❌ DO NOT include timing/date information in Encounter resources
✅ If you need to track timing, put it in the journey metadata only

Example minimal Encounter (COPY THIS STRUCTURE EXACTLY - DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER FIELDS):
{
  "resourceType": "Encounter",
  "id": "example-id",
  "status": "finished",
  "class": [
    {
      "coding": [{
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode",
        "code": "EMER",
        "display": "emergency"
      }]
    }
  ],
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/patient-id"
  }
}
```

### 3. Automatic Field Cleaning (Lines 1786-1813)

Added a new `_clean_forbidden_fields()` method that automatically strips out forbidden fields before validation:

```python
def _clean_forbidden_fields(self, resource: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Remove forbidden fields that cause validation errors from a resource.

    Args:
        resource: The FHIR resource dict

    Returns:
        Cleaned resource dict
    """
    resource_type = resource.get("resourceType")

    # Map of resource types to forbidden fields
    forbidden_fields_map = {
        "Encounter": ["period", "start", "end", "reasonCode", "timestamp"],
        "Procedure": ["performedDateTime", "performedPeriod"],
        "Observation": ["valueComponent"],
    }

    forbidden_fields = forbidden_fields_map.get(resource_type, [])

    if forbidden_fields:
        for field in forbidden_fields:
            if field in resource:
                print(f"  ⚠️  Removing forbidden field '{field}' from {resource_type}")
                del resource[field]

    return resource
```

This method is called in:

- `_generate_single_resource()` (line 841)
- `_generate_single_resource_async()` (line 959)
- `_fix_invalid_resource()` (line 1276)
- `_fix_invalid_resource_async()` (line 1135)

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

```bash
cd /Users/bkyritz/Code/Jori/Open-Compute
python examples/patient_journey_to_fhir_example.py
```

The example should now complete successfully without "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors on Encounter resources.

## Additional Notes

- The fix is defensive programming - it works at multiple layers
- Even if the AI ignores the guidance, the cleaning function catches the errors
- The same approach can be extended to other resource types that have similar issues
- Timing information for encounters can still be tracked in the journey stage metadata
- The solution maintains FHIR compliance while working around library limitations

## Related Issues

This fix also addresses similar issues with:

- `Procedure` resources with `performedDateTime`/`performedPeriod` fields
- `Observation` resources with `valueComponent` fields

The solution is extensible - just add more entries to `forbidden_fields_map` as needed.
